**Type:** Regression | Machine Learning Pipeline  

---

## 📌 Project Summary
Built an end-to-end machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars using real-world data.  
The project covers data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

## ⚙️ Key Work Done
- Cleaned dataset (missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Performed EDA to identify price-driving factors
- Trained multiple models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Compared performance and optimized model using feature engineering
- Final model achieved **R² = 0.96**

---

## 📊 Key Insight
Vehicle age, fuel type, and driven kilometers strongly influence resale price.  
Tree-based models performed best on this dataset.
